Student Work Slideshow for ACCE displays

A JS app to run on the digital displays in the ACCE building at Algonquin College. It is primarily used to randomize a defined amount of slides showcasing student work from a total pool. On the Appspace manager, I place the other announcements to allow for better flow.

e.g. (student-slideshow: *[student-slide-1] > [student-slide-2] > [student-slide-3] > [student-slide-4]* ) > [Announcement] > restart
